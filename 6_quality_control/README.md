quality control 1: removed ~90 samples due to lack of global correlation

quality control 2: 

r cut off = 95, 435 experiments remained, reference condition (condition 526)
- stationary phase, OD = 30

r cut off = 90, 853 experiments remained, new reference condition (condition 469)
- exponential phase, growth rate 0.6
